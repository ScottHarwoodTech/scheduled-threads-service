We've made a guide here for how this will work, and most of this is the normal rules we've had for the showcases over the last few years with a few new rules to help keep it concise and fair to all:

1) This Thread will remain open for people to post their work until 6:30pm bst on Sunday that week (After the GW preview). The thread will then be locked, not allowing anyone else to post for that week's showcase.

2) Each community member will be allowed 1 post, with up to 3 photos for projects they have finished.
     a.    This means that all your minis will be together during the showcase rather than spread-out at different times. 
     b.    A project is any Model, Unit, finished work etcâ€¦ that you have completed, and which has not already been on a showcase.

3) No Instagram/Socials links in showcase section. These will not be shown on the Twitch Showcases and will be deleted.`
